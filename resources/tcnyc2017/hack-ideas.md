# Some Civic Hack Ideas

Feel free to use these as inpiration for your hacks this weekend!

Building around one of these ideas doesn't make you any more or less likely to win our prize, but hopefully inspires you to build something interesting and powerful :)

# Flu Shot Finder
## Problem:
Finding the nearest flu shot provider can be difficult. Flu shots are an important precaution to promote a healthy community. Provider locations should be accessible and easily discoverable yet there are no centralized or third-party resources for this information. You can help by leveraging Esri to curate a database of locations and expose them through a user-friendly dashboard.

# Crime Data
## Problem:
The increase in available and accessible crime data can yield more efficient crime-prevention programs and safer communities. Promote safety by using this data to assist crime-prevention actions with an app. This app could help allocate patrol resources, avoid navigation through high-crime areas, or select and monitor capital investments such as streetlights.

# Air Quality Assessments
## Problem:
Increased environmental consciousness has created demand for air quality monitoring systems. At the same time, decreased sensor costs and improved reporting technology have made these systems viable. Create an app that could help monitor, disseminate, assess, or act on current air quality conditions.

# 311
## Problem:
Modern technology allows citizens to easily connect with government initiatives. These initiatives can range from pothole repair to graffiti removal. Create an app that helps citizens further engage with initiatives or that helps governments manage this engagement.
