# Crime Data
## Problem:
The increase in available and accessible crime data can yield more efficient crime-prevention programs and safer communities. Promote safety by using this data to assist crime-prevention actions with an app. This app could help allocate patrol resources, avoid navigation through high-crime areas, or select and monitor capital investments such as streetlights.
