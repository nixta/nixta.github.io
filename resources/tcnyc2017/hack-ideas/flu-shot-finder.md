# Flu Shot Finder
## Problem:
Finding the nearest flu shot provider can be difficult. Flu shots are an important precaution to promote a healthy community. Provider locations should be accessible and easily discoverable yet there are no centralized or third-party resources for this information. You can help by leveraging Esri to curate a database of locations and expose them through a user-friendly dashboard.
